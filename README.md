Netflix Movies and TV shows Unsupervised Learning.<br>
 # Summary: <br>
     Got a dataset having 7787 records and 12 features, which is not labeled. Then I          
     started by understanding the data followed by missing/null value treatment,  
     then some feature engineering for data visualization and then data visualization 
     performed. After getting insights from data I did some feature engineering like 
     text cleaning, TF-IDF, PCA on data. Then after selecting no. of clusters, I built 
     the KMeans clustering model. After that I assigned the clusters in our dataset 
     and created word cloud for each cluster and after that calculated silhouette 
     score for evaluation purpose.<br>
  # Problem Statement:-<br>
This dataset consists of tv shows and movies available on Netflix as of 2019. The dataset is collected from Flexible which is a third-party Netflix search engine.
In 2018, they released an interesting report which shows that the number of TV shows on Netflix has nearly tripled since 2010. The streaming serviceâ€™s number of movies has decreased by more than 2,000 titles since 2010, while its number of TV shows has nearly tripled. It will be interesting to explore what all other insights can be obtained from the same dataset.
Integrating this dataset with other external datasets such as IMDB ratings, rotten tomatoes can also provide many interesting findings.
     
  # Agenda:-<br>
Exploratory Data Analysis
Understanding what type content is available in different countries
Netflix has increasingly focused on TV rather than movies in recent years.
Clustering similar content by matching text-based features
   # Conclusion:-<br>
       It's clear that Netflix has grown over the years. We can see it from the data that the   
       company took certain approaches in their marketing strategy to break into new  
       markets around the world. Based on an article from Business Insider, Netflix had 
       about 158 million subscribers worldwide with 60 million from the US and almost 98 
       million internationally. Netflix's original subscriber base was based solely in the 
       United States following its IPO. A large part of its success was due to the decision 
       to expand to international markets. The popular markets prioritizes what content 
       the company will release. In this case, we can see that a good amount of 
       international movies and TV shows were added over the years as part of Netflix's 
       global expansion.
